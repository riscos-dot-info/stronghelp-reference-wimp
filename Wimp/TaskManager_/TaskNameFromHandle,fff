TaskManager_TaskNameFromHandle (&42680)
#Parent TaskManager_

<=	R0 =	pointer to taskname
#line
This SWI returns the description string which the task used when it called <Wimp_Initialise>, which is also the string shown in the task manager window. You should copy the string if you wish to keep it.

If a <Message_TaskInitialise=>Msg_400c2> has just been received by a task, then this SWI may not return a valid name for the same handle since the TaskManager itself may not have received the message yet. As the task name is supplied in the message, this should not be a problem.
