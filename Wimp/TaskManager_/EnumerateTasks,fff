#Parent TaskManager_
=>	R0 =	0 for first call, or value from previous
	R1 =	pointer to buffer
	R2 =	size of buffer

<=	R0 =	value to use for next call, or \< 0 for no more
	R1 =	pointer to end of buffer filled
	R2 =	bytes not used

This SWI returns information about the running tasks. This is necessarily the same list as TaskManager displays. For each task a 4 word block is returned :

#Tab
0	Task handle
4	Task name (which should be copied if you use it)
8	Slot size (K)
12	<Flags=>.flags>
#Line
See <PRM 3, page 315=>PRM-3:315>.
#Subpage flags
Task flags
Bit	Meaning if set
#Line
0	module task (otherwise application task)
1	slot bar can be dragged (otherwise it can't)
