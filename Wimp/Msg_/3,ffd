This message is sent by the Filer to ask an application to load a file, or by a task in response to a <DataSaveAck=>Msg_2> message.

When replying to a <DataSaveAck=>Msg_2>, the data-saving task should write its data to the temporary file specified, and reply by sending this message. It should be sent as a <UserMessage_Recorded=>Wimp_Sendmessage.1> so that if it returns unanswered, the sender can delete the temporary file and report an error.

Possible responses from the data-loading task:
  è	It sends <DataLoadAck=>Msg_4> (file successfully loaded).
  è	It doesn't reply (error loading file/not interested in filetype).
