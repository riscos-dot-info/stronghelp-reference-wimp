Message_DataSavd (13)
#Parent MSG_
This message is sent back to the originator of a saved file if at some later time it becomes "safe" ({/}i.e.{/} on disc). You should compare the <your_ref=>Wimp_SendMessage1> in this message with the my_ref you stored when you sent the original <DataSave=>Msg_1> message - if they tally the file can now be marked as safe, unless the user had edited it in the meantime.

Probably the best implementation is for your program to store the my_ref with the file, but zero it on any modification, as 0 will not be a valid your_ref. It appears that this message is designed for cases where one program saves a file to another program, and then that second program saves the unmodified file to disc.
