TaskNameRq (&400C6)
#Parent MSG_
+ 20	Handle of other task

This message can be used if your task want to find out the name of another task. Broadcast this message with correct handle, and the task manager will respond with a <TaskNameIs=>Msg_400C7> message. RISC OS 3 provides <TaskManager_TaskNameFromHandle>, which should be used in preference.
