This message is sent to !Printers to initiate a print session. This should be sent recorded delivery (code 18), and if it bounces then you should complain that no printer driver is present.

#tab
Printers will respond with one of :
 è	<PrintError=>Msg_80144> if the printer is busy.
 è	<PrintFile=>Msg_80140> (for compatability with RISC OS 2 applications).
 è	<PrintTypeOdd=>Msg_80145> if it doesn't know how to print the file.
 è	<DataSaveAck=>Msg_2> if the file should be saved for queueing (later, a PrintTypeOdd message will be broadcast).
