External Edit Protocol

The protocol consists of these five messages :
    
   <Message_EditRq=>Msg_45d80>
   <Message_EditAck=>Msg_45d81>
   <Message_EditReturn=>Msg_45d82>
   <Message_EditAbort=>Msg_45d83>
   <Message_EditDataSave=>Msg_45d84>
   <Message_EditCursor=>Msg_45d85>

The purpose of the protocol is to allow one task (the "<Clients=>Msg_ExtEditClient>") to send its data to another task (the "<Editor=>Msg_ExtEditEditor>") for editing, without forcing the user to "drag things all over the place.."

Applications supporting the protocol include :
Clients :
#Indent 2
#Table Lines 2
!OLRead
!JFAddress
!NoteIt
!FidoMail
!MakeARPC
#EndTable
#Indent

Editors :
#Indent 2
#Table Lines 2
!StrongED
!Zap 1.20
!DJF-JRF
!FormEdExt
#EndTable
#Indent

How useful this protocol will be, depends on how many tasks support it, both as "Client" and "Editors".
