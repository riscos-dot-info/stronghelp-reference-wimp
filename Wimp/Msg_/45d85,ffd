This message is sent by a client who wishes the editor to position its cursor exactly. The reply is then returned by the editor to indicate the old cursor, start and end positions.

All data has positions starting with the first unit as 1, the next as 2 and so on. To position a pointer before the start of the data use 0, and after the end use -2.

{fH4}Special cursor meanings{f}
To leave a field unchanged it should use -1, therefore three -1's will read the current position of the cursor. If there is no concept of cursor or selection then the appropriate fields must be set to -1 by the editor. The editor should never return -2 as a position.

<Unit meanings=>Msg_ExtEditCursorUnits> differ depending on the filetype.
