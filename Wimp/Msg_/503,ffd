Max length = 256-20-1 = 235 chars. <Escape codes=>Msg_503Codes> may be used under RISC OS 3 !Help or equivalent.

The current !Help implementation passes the message block direct to <OS_GSTrans=>OS:OS_GSTrans> before checking for "\\" escape codes - hence passing CR or LF terminated strings and using "|" codes other than {fCode}|M{f} is undocumented.
