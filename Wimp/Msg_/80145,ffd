Message_PrintTypeOdd  (&80145)
#Parent MSG_
+ 40	<filetype=>Filetypes:!Root> of data
+ 44	filename

This message is sent by !Printers when it doesn't know how to print the file. The filetype and filename cannot be relied on if we have just come from a <PrintSave=>Msg_80142> message, though why the PRM's state this, I'm not sure.

If an application knows how to print that filetype (doh, how can you do this if you can't rely on it ?) then it should respond with <PrintTypeKnown=>Msg_80146> and either :
 è	Print the file to Printer:
 è	Output the file (does this mean print again ?) to Printer$Temp /before/ responding with PrintTypeKnown.

If it does not know the type, then it should ignore the message and await a <DataSaveAck=>Msg_2> (which may never arrive if another application knows how to print the file) to queue the file for later printing.
