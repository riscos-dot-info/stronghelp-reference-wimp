Message_PrintTypeOdd  (&80145)
#Parent MSG_
+ 40	<filetype=>Filetypes:!Root> of data
+ 44	filename

This message is sent by !Printers when it doesn't know how to print the file. The filetype and filename cannot be relied on if we have just come from a <PrintSave=>Msg_80142> message, but since the application started the print protocol it should still remember what it was planing to print.

When this message is sent by !Printers to print a file from its queue, the information is correct.

If an application knows how to print that filetype then it should respond with <PrintTypeKnown=>Msg_80146> and either :
 è	Print the file to Printer:
 è	Output the file to Printer$Temp /before/ responding with PrintTypeKnown.

If it does not know the type, then it should ignore the message and await a <DataSaveAck=>Msg_2> (which may never arrive if another application knows how to print the file) to queue the file for later printing.
