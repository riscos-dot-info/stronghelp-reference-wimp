NewsBase_AddGroup (120)
+32	group name or pattern

Adds group(s) to the active list. This is not the same as 'subscribing' a group for an individual user (which should be handled solely by the client program) - it adds the group(s) to the news feed. May not be supported or appropriate for all transport types.

For ka9q, if more than one newsfeed is present (multiple xxxGroup files), the group(s) are added to the largest file (it is assumed that this is the primary server).
