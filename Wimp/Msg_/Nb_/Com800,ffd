NewsBase_ReEdit (800)
+24	file type (0=mail, 1=news)
+28	reference number
+32	filename to re-edit

This message should be broadcast by a queue control program, when the user indicates they wish to re-edit an already-queued file. 

The reference number is generated by the queue control program, and will be returned by any Newsbase_Reply message requiring further action (such as deleting the original queue entry). This is intended to aid use with multiple re-edit sessions.

Note that while a re-edit session is in progress, the message should be locked in some way to prevent it from being sent. For ka9q, a file could be created in the "lock" directory. Other methods may be needed for other transport types.

Not used at present - may be discarded, as more complicated than necessary (see, eg, !Qedit for simpler method).
