NewsBase_ListArtsInfo (210)
+24	first article number (0=first)
+28	last article number (0=last)
+32	group name
+32+n	string of <flags=>.flags> indicating data required

Returns a list of article numbers with extra header information. Replies take the form of one <Newsbase_Reply 200=>Msg_NB_Rep200> message (From, Subject and Message-ID) and one or more <Newsbase_Reply 210=>Msg_NB_Rep210> message, containing the extra data, for each article.

More than one data item may be requested - eg, a flag string of "rdx" would return, for each article, first the normal Newsbase_Reply 200 message, followed by three Newsbase_Reply 210 messages; containing the References, Date and Xref: headers.

It should not normally be necessary to request the Date, From, Subject, or Message-ID headers, as this information is returned in Newsbase_Reply 200 anyway. However, they may be requested if the information is important (as the Newsbase_Reply 200 forms may be truncated due to the limited space available in a single Wimp message).

For compatibility with older versions of Newsbase, if no flag string is given, the flag "r" (to return References) is assumed.
