NewsBase_SetReturnPath (320)
+32	envelope 'From' address, or null to clear

The Envelope "From" address may be provided should the Newsbase-supplied one be unsuitable (eg, for mailing list software). This command need only be sent once to set the value for a client, and it will be remembered for that session until altered or cleared.
