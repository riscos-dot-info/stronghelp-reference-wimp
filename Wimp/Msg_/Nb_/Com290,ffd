Returns a filename for the group overview information. This file contains article header information in a standard format, and can provide a faster way of obtaining article information than the Wimp message lists from commands 200 & 210. The filename returned can be used to directly load or copy the data, but should not be stored across Wimp_Polls, as it may simply be a scrap file.

Several polls may occur between sending this message and receiving the reply (in the case that a new overview file has to be generated).

If first/last article numbers are supplied, then a subset overview file is created containing only those article numbers, and the filename returned is temporary (not yet supported).
