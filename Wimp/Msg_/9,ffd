Message_PaletteChange (9)
#Parent Msg_
This message is broadcast by the palette utility when the RGB value for one or more physical colours have changed. <Message_ModeChange=>MSG_400C1> is broadcast *instead* of this message at a mode change.

In 256 colour modes, it is not the physical colour which changes, but only the mapping from logical to physical colour. In that case the palette utility itself forces a redraw of the whole screen.
