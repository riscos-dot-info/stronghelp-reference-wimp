This indicates that the sender wants to save data to the receiver. Conventionally, if this message is ignored, then the sender gives up silently.

You should store the my_ref of each data save message, to check against any future <DataSaved=>Msg_D> message you might receive.

Normal use:
  è	User has terminated a drag.
  è	Get the first four words with <Wimp_GetPointerInfo>
  è	Send the message to mentioned window.

Possible responses from other task:
  è	It sends <DataSaveAck=>Msg_2> (wishes to use file transfer)
  è	It sends <RamFetch=>Msg_6> (wishes to use memory transfer)
  è	It doesn't reply (not interested in files of that type)
