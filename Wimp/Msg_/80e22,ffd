Message_OLEOpenSessionAck  (&80E22)
#Parent MSG_
Same data as for <Message_OLEOpenSession=>Msg_80e21>

The OLE server replies to OLE_OpenSession by changing message_id to OLE_OpenSessionAck, setting your_ref = my_ref, and sending it back. Client then knows which task is editing its file.

It is returned in reply to an OLEOpenSession message. Server has loaded file, and has established the link.

What should happen if server gets an error while reading file? (Protection or not enough memory) It should probably send this message immediately followed by an OLECloseSession message.
