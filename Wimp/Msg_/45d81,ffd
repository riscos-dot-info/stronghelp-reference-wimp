+ 28	<Flag word=>Msg_ExtEditFlags>

This message is returned by the "editor" after receiving an <EditRq=>Msg_45d80> message from a "client". Editor sets the top 16 bits of the Job Handle to a unique value, and both tasks will from now on use the full 32 bit word as a unique job handle. Editor may also change some bits in the Flag Word.

Editor should create and open an empty document. If the "client" wants to, it might fill the empty doc with data by sending an <EditDataSave=>Msg_45d84> message.

This message is part of the "<External Edit=>Msg_ExtEdit>" protocol.
