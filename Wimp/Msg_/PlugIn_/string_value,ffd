'String_value' in the Plugin Protocol
#Parent Msg_PlugIn_
Many of the strings passed around in this protocol are of unspecified size and may, especially in the case of URL's, be larger than could fit within the body of a wimp message. Therefore, they are defined in this spec as {fCode}string_value{f}s.

These are also used in the Browser spec and are defined as being either :
#Indent 2
è	if \< 256, offsets from the start of the message body (+20 in messages)
è	if \> 256, pointers to data held in shared memory (eg the RMA or a dynamic area).
#indent

It is always the responsibility of the sender to free the memory used for any pointers after they are no longer requied.

The protocol is defined in such a way that there should always be a reply received or the message will be bounced by the Wimp. In either case it is then safe for the sender to free the memory allocated.
