#subpage copyright
Plugin 'About' directory
A plug-in may display a logo and some associated text (e.g. copyright information) in a browser's window at the user's request. The suggested URL for this is 'about:'. The system variable {fCode}PlugIn$About_{/}type{/}{f} points to a directory containing text files with optional image (PNG, GIF or JPEG) files.

Each file has a two digit reference number to allow a single plug-in to have multiple logos and copyright entries (e.g. each Replay codec). The file '{fCode}About{/}yy{/}{f}', where {/}yy{/} is the two digit reference number, contains the text suitable for inclusion inside a table cell of an HTML document.

For each About file there is an optional image file, of the name '{fCode}{/}yywwwwhhhh{/}{f}', where {/}wwww{/} and {/}hhhh{/} are each four digits for the size that the image will be scaled to (usually the same as the actual image size). It is strongly recommended that the width and height are specified, but a filename of just '{fCode}{/}yy{/}{f}' is accepted.

If the plug-in has a single copyright message and logo, the filename '{fCode}About{f}' can be used as a shortcut for '{fCode}About00{f}'. The optional logo must still be called '{fCode}00{/}wwwwhhhh{/}{f}' or '00'.

It is the browser's responsibility to enumerate all the {fCode}PlugIn$About_*{f} system variables and compile an HTML document containing all available plug-in details.
