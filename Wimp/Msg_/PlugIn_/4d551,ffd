This message is used for sending specific commands to a plugin.  Not all plugins will understand the commands sent.

The new state sent it the state the plugin should enter.  If it is already in that state, then it should ignore the message.

After entering the state, it should send back a <PlugIn_Busy=>Msg_Plugin_4D550> message giving the new state except for the Mute and Unmute actions.
