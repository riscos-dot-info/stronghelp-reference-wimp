Requests that the parent display some indication of business (e.g. spinning logo, etc.).  If the plugin has set the busy bit in its <PlugIn_Opening=>Msg_Plugin_4D541> message then it should send this message with bit 0 clear when it has finished its loading.

This is also used to notify the parent of any state change by the plugin in case it needs to update any user interface.
