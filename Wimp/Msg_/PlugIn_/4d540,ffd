This message is sent by the browser to create a plugin instance.

The file specified contains a series of parameters in the form of name-value pairs.  This data is the list of attributes and parameters from the APPLET, OBJECT or EMBED tag - see their respective definitions.  <This data=>msg_plugin_formats> is used by the plugin to understand what is being requested of it.

If bit 0 of the flags word is set then this is a request to open the file as a helper appliation.  i.e. external to the parent application.  In this case the bounding box (offset bytes 35 to 51) are invalid.  The parent window handle may be valid or 0 depending on how the file is launched.

Usually a plugin application will respond with <Message_PlugIn_Opening=>Msg_PlugIn_4D541>.
