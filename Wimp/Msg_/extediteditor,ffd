External Edit editors
The editor application is defined as that which accepts editing session messages, ie that within which the editing of the object takes place.

Upon receipt of an external edit request broadcast (<EditRq=>Msg_45d80>), the editor checks the <data type=>Msg_ExtEditDatatypes>, and if it is able to edit the data, it opens a suitable window (on a 'blank' datafile) and replies to the  message (with <EditAck=>Msg_45d81>). 

It will allow the user to edit the data (unless the request was for read-only data), and can also handle some extra functions:

è If a data transfer is started by the client (<EditDataSave=>Msg_45d84>), it will insert the new data  into the ExtEdit data, at the current 'cursor' position (usually the end of the file).

è If the client requests the data back (<EditReturn=>Msg_45d82>), or if the user chooses the 'save' menu option, a reverse data transfer will be initiated back to the client.

è Closing the ExtEdit window should abort the transfer /without/ returning the data to the client.

è If the client request a new selection to be highlighted (<EditCursor=>Msg_45d85>), then the editor should move to the location specified and display the higlighting as required.
