Message_PreQuit (8)
#Parent Msg_
+ 20	flag, bit 0 clear if desktop shutdown, set if just you
	(check the block length - if \< 20 bytes assume a flag word of 0)

This message is broadcast when Ctrl-Shift F12 is pressed. It is also sent to a specific task when the user tries to quit it from the task display menu.

If you have no objections to being killed, ignore this message and you will eventually receive a <Quit message=>Msg_0>.

If you object to being killed (for example if you have unsaved data), you should <acknowledge=>wimp_sendmessage3> this message, then open a dialogue box asking the user what to do. If the user chooses to quit and the 'flag' was zero, you are supposed to restart the shutdown sequence by emitting a Ctrl-Shift F12 (508), using <Wimp_ProcessKey>.

The 'flag' is new under RISC OS 3. Under RISC OS 2 there was no way of knowing if only your task was being quit or the whole desktop.

Note that the protocol is still buggy, in that if shutdown has been initiated by 'Exit' on the taskmanager menu, then it will be restarted by the program as 'Shutdown'.
