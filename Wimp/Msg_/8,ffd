Message_PreQuit (8)
#Parent Msg_
+ 20	flag, 0 if closedown, not if single-quit
	(check the block length - if \< 20 bytes assume a flag word of 0)

This message is broadcasted when Ctrl-Shift F12 is pressed. It is also sent to a specific task, when the user tries to quit it from the task display menu.

If you have no objections to being killed, then ignore this message, and you will eventually receive a <Quit message=>Msg_0>.

If you object to being killed (unsaved data..), you should <acknowledge=>wimp_sendmessage3> this message, and then open a dialogue box asking the user what to do. If the user chooses to quit and the 'flag' was zero, you are supposed to restart the closedown sequence by emitting a Ctrl-Shift F12 (508), using <Wimp_ProcessKey>.

The 'flag' is new under RO3. Under RO2 there was no way of knowing if only your task was being quit, or the whole desktop.

Note that the protocol is still buggy, in that if closedown has been initiated by 'Exit' on the taskmanager menu, then it will be restarted by the program as 'Shutdown'
