Message_MenuWarning  (&400C0)
#Parent MSG_
+ 20	'Submenu pointer' from menu item
+ 24	x coord of top left new submenu
+ 28	y coord of top left new submenu
+ 32	Selection list (as in <MenuSelection=>wimp_poll9>)

You receive this message when pointer moves over the submenu arrow in a menu entry with the 'generate message' bit set.

You can use the 'submenu pointer' and/or the selection list, to decide which window or menu to open with <Wimp_CreateSubMenu>. The submenu you actually open doesn't have to be the same as the one passed to you at +20. However, if you wish the submenu to be re-opened when the Wimp recreates the menu you should store the new handle at +20.
