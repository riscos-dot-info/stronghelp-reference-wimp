Message_PrintInit  (&80143)
#Parent MSG_
This message is sent by !Printers when it has loaded. All other printer drivers should quit quietly on receiving this message.

The PRM's do not specify what should happen if the active printer driver is 'actively' printing. I would recommend that such drivers should complain and send <PreQuit=>Msg_8> followed by <Quit=>Msg_0> to the originator of such messages.
