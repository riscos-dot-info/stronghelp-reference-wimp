#
#Subpage A
Validation string 'A'
*Use*:	Exclude/accept only certain characters into a writeable icon.

*Syntax*:	{Fcode:A[char list][~exclusion list]}

#subpage C
Validation string 'C' (3.98+)
*Use*:	To allow 24-bit colours to be specified for icons.
#line
{/}{*}Wimp 3.98+{*}{/}
*Syntax*:	{FCode:C\{BBGGRR\}[/\{BBGGRR\}]}
	First BBGGRR is the foreground colour, the second is the backgound colour.
	If either colour is not included, then colour is as the <flags word=>wimp_iconflags>
#line
{/}{*}Wimp 4.00+{*}{/}
*Syntax*:	{fCode}C[foreground]/
		 [background]/
		 [slabbed-in background]/
		 [moat]/
		 [light 3D edge]/
		 [dark 3D edge]{f}
	All colours are in the form BBGGRR
	If any colour is not included, then colour is as the <flags word=>wimp_iconflags>
#line
*Examples*:	{FCode:C008000/0080FF}	foreground mid green, background orange.
	{FCode:CFF00FF}		foreground magenta, background as for flags word.
	{FCode:C/00FFFF}	foreground as for flags word, background yellow.
#
#Subpage D
Validation string 'D'
*Use*:	The masking of the contents of icons. Usually used in password icons.

*Syntax*:	{Fcode:Dchar}
	Displays all typed chars as 'char'
	Special characters must be preceded by a \\

*Examples*:	{Fcode:D*}	Contents of the icon is displayed as a series of *'s.
		{Fcode:D\-}	Contents displayed as a series of '-'s
#
#Subpage F
Validation string 'F'
*Use*:	The definition of outline font colours.

*Syntax*:	{Fcode:Fxy}
	x = Background
	y = Foreground.
	x and y are hexadecimal digits: 0..9,A..F

*Notes*:	This call uses <Wimp_SetFontColours>.

*Examples*:	{Fcode:FA3}	sets background to 10 and foreground to 3.
	{Fcode:F07}	sets background to 0 and foreground to 7 (default).
#
#Subpage K
Validation string 'K'
*Use*:	Assigns functionality to specific keys.

*Syntax*:	{Fcode:Koptions}

*Options*:	R	Return moves caret to next writable icon. (Except for last.)
	A	Up/Down arrow moves to prev/next writable
	T	Tab moves to next, shift-Tab to previous
	D	Deleting will also report the keypress
	N	Task will be notified of all keypresses in icon

*Examples*:	{Fcode:Ktarn}
		{Fcode}Knd{f}
#
#Subpage L
Validation string 'L'
*Use*:	Formatting text to fit the icon as best as possible.

*Syntax*:	{Fcode:Lh}
	h is the vertical spacing between lines of text in OS units. If omitted, 40 units is used (a system font character is 32 OS units high).

*Notes*:	This option can only be used with icons which are horizontally and vertically centred, and do not contain an anti-aliased font. The icon must not be writeable, since the caret would not be positioned correctly inside it.

 		The height will only take effect on Window Manager 3.80 and later.

*Examples*:	{Fcode:L40}
#
#Subpage P
Validation string 'P'
*Use*:	The changing of the pointer shape and active point.

*Syntax*:	{Fcode:Pspritename[,x,y]}
	spritename is a sprite in the Wimp sprite pool.
	x and y are the new active points for the pointer.

*Examples*:	{Fcode:Pptr_write,4,4}	Pointer for writable icons.
		{Fcode:Pptr_menu,6,5}	Pointer for pop-up menu icons.
#
#Subpage R
Validation string 'R'
*Use*:	Three dimensional borders for icons.

*Syntax*:	{Fcode:Rtype[,pushcolour]}
	pushcolour is used for when the icon is in a selected state for types 5 and 6.
*Types*:	1	slab out
		2	slab in
		3	ridge
		4	channel
		5	action button
		6	default action
		7	writable

 		{Fcode:R4}	Style Guide recommended border type.
#
#Subpage S
Validation string 'S'
*Use*:	Including sprites in indirected icons

*Syntax*:	{Fcode:Sspritename[,<selected\>]}
	selected is used for when the icon is in a selected state.

*Examples*:	{Fcode}	Sswitcher
		Soptoff,opton{F}
#
#subpage T
Validation string 'T'
*Use*:	Apply a colour translation to an icon

*Syntax*:	{/}Select 1 (deprecated){/}
		    {fCode:T0,\<BBGGRR\>}
		{/}Select 3 and later{/}
		    {fCode:T\<type\>[,\<parameters\>]}
		
*Notes*:	Type is the decimal type number as defined by the ColourMap module. Parameters is a comma separated list of hex numbers passed in R3 to R9 to the ColourMap module when creating the colourmap descriptor.
#
#subpage X
Validation string 'X'
*Use*:	Disable the Wimp's calculation of text in text+sprite icons on the iconbar.

*Syntax*:	{fCode:X}

*Notes*:	When you place a text+sprite icon on the iconbar, the Wimp will automatically calculate the width of the text and hence the icon. If your application may change the text at some point later (for example to display a status), you instead need to calculate the largest width of all potential strings (using <Wimp_TextOp 1=>Wimp_TextOp>) and create the icon with this width - disabling the wimp's calculaton by using the X validation string command.

	You should recalculate the widths and resize the icon when you receive <Message_FontChanged=>msg_400cf>.
#
#subpage Y
Validation string 'Y'
*Use*:	Set an feature flag applying to the icon.

*Syntax*:	{fCode:Y\<option list\>}
		
*Notes*:	This string enables various features for the icon depending on the letters present.

*Types*:	S	Icon should be sent Message_ScrollRequest when a mouse's scroll wheel is moved while over it.

*Example*:	{fCode:Ys}
