Wimp_ProcessKey  (&400DC)
#Parent Wimp_
=>	R0 =	<Character code=>wimp_poll8a>.
<=	R0 corrupt

#Tab
This call has two uses:
  1 :	Pass on keypresses that your program has received from Wimp_Poll <reason 8=>Wimp_poll8>, but doesn't use.
  2 :	Insert keypresses into the wimp buffer.

#Tab
Note 1 :	You should not insert more than one or two characters at a time this way. It seems that the Wimp gets confused after that.

Note 2 :	Characters inserted this way takes precedence over characters in the keyboard buffer.
#Line
