other registers depend on R0

Operations on text in the current desktop font.

See also <Wimp_ReadSysInfo> with R0 = 8.
#
#Subpage 0
Wimp_TextOp 0 (&400F9)
=>	R0 =	0 (reason code)
	R1 =	foreground colour
	R2 =	background colour

Sets the text colours in the form &BBGGRR00.

#Subpage 1
Wimp_TextOp 1 (&400F9)
=>	R0 =	1 (reason code)
	R1 =	Pointer to string
	R2 =	Number of characters to scan, or 0 for whole string

<=	R0 =	String width in OS units

Calculates the width of a (sub)string, if plotted in the current desktop font. Desktop font can be outline font or old BBC-type font.

Wimp_TextOp 2 (&400F9)
=>	R0 =	2 + flags:
	 	 	/Bit/	/Meaning/
	 	 	30	Vertically justify, so baseline of characters is at same height as when using system font
	 	 	31	Right-justify 
	R1 =	Pointer to string
	R2 =	-1
	R3 =	-1
	R4 =	X coordinate
	R5 =	Y coordinate

Plots a string in the current desktop font.

Wimp_TextOp 3 (&400F9) [4.00]
=>	R0 =	3 (reason code)
	R1 =	pointer to string
	R2 =	width in OS units
	R3 =	split character

<=	R0 =	pointer to split point
	all others preserved
#
#Subpage 4
Wimp_TextOp 4 (&400F9) [4.00]
=>	R0 =	4 (reason code)
	R1 =	pointer to string
	R2 =	pointer to output buffer
	R3 =	buffer size, or 0 to find required size
	R4 = 	maximum width in OS units

<=	R0 =	required buffer size
	all others preserved

This call fills the buffer with the string, truncated if necessary with an ellipsis. Depending on the current alphabet and Wimp font, either an ellipsis character is used, or three full stops.
