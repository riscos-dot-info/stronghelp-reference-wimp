Justin Fletcher's WimpHack module provides an implementation of this SWI for Wimps lower than 3.5. In the event of the Wimp_ResizeIcon not being available (e.g. test using <OS_SWINumberFromString=>OS:OS_SWINumberFromString>, one is able to load the WimpHack module and call <WimpHack_ResizeIcon=>MiscSWIs:WimpHack_ResizeIcon> (&C0480) with the same parameters.
