Wimp_ForceRedraw  (&400D1)
#Parent Wimp_
=>	R0 =	window handle, -2 for iconbar, or -1 for absolute co-ordinates
	R1 =	minimum x
	R2 =	minimum y
	R3 =	maximum x
	R4 =	maximum y
<=	R0 corrupted

This SWI marks area of screen as invalid, and to be redrawn later. If you are doing some kind of animation, or other temporary changes, then you should use <Wimp_UpdateWindow> instead.

Coordinates are relative to the window's work area, unless R0 is -1 on entry in which case absolute screen coordinates are given.

Under the nested Wimp it is possible to force a redraw of windows which do not belong to the application, and an <extended version=>.nested> is available.

Wimp_ForceRedraw (nested version)
=>	R0 =	window handle
	R1 =	"TASK" (&4B534154)
	R2 =	3 - update the title bar
# or 0: all furniture
#    1: back icon
#    2: close icon
#    3: title bar
#    4: toggle size icon
#    5: vertical scroll bar
#    6: size icon
#    7: horizontal scroll bar
#    8: iconise button

This call is the best way to force a redraw of the window's title bar, when available.
