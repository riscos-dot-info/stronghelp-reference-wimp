#Parent Wimp_
=>	R0 =	window handle, -2 for iconbar, or -1 for absolute co-ordinates
	R1 =	minimum x
	R2 =	minimum y
	R3 =	maximum x
	R4 =	maximum y
<=	R0 corrupted

This SWI marks area of screen as invalid, and to be redrawn later. If you are doing some kind of animation, or other temporary changes, then you should use <Wimp_UpdateWindow> instead.

Under the nested Wimp it is possible to force a redraw of windows which do not belong to the application. An <extended version=>.nested> is available.

=>	R0 =	window handle
	R1 =	"TASK" (&4B534154)
