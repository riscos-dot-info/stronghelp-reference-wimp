=>	R0 =	Last <Wimp version known=>.known> × 100
	R1 =	"TASK" (&4B534154)
	R2 =	pointer to short description for taskmanager
(Version 3.00):
	R3 =	pointer to <list=>.list300> of acceptable <user messages=>Msg_>.
(Version 3.10 or later):
	R3 =	pointer to <list=>.list310> of acceptable <user messages=>Msg_>.

	R1 =	task handle

If a list of user messages is given the task will not be polled in for other messages - swapping the memory associated with tasks is time consuming, so not having to do this for a message that the task will only ignore gives a large speedup. The task can alter this list if necessary with <Wimp_AddMessages> and <Wimp_RemoveMessages>. Before the program terminates, it should call <Wimp_CloseDown>.

In the event of the version given being later than the version of the Wimp available, then an error will be generated.

Wimp_Initialise R3 (RISC OS 3.00)
In RISC OS 3.00, but not later versions, R3 on entry to <Wimp_Initialise> should contain a list of acceptable <user messages=>Msg_>, terminated by a 0 word.

If R3 = 0 then all messages are classified as important.

In R3 contains a pointer to a list containing merely the 0 word then *no* messages are important.

{/}[most of this is speculation. anyone care to fill in the details?]{/}

#subpage list310
Wimp_Initialise R3 (RISC OS 3.10+)
In RISC OS 3.10 or later, R3 on entry to <Wimp_Initialise> should contain a list of acceptable <user messages=>Msg_>, terminated by a 0 word.

In R3 = 0 then no messages are classified as important except for the 'Quit' message.

In R3 contains a pointer to a list containing merely the 0 word then *all* messages are classified as important.
