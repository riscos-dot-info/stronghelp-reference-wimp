If a list of user messages is given the task will not be polled in for other messages - swapping the memory associated with tasks is time consuming, so not having to do this for a message that the task will only ignore gives a large speedup. The task can alter this list if necessary with <Wimp_AddMessages> and <Wimp_RemoveMessages>. Before the program terminates, it should call <Wimp_CloseDown>.

#Line
200	RISC OS 2 WindowManager
	No use of pollwords, indirected menu titles, menu help, validation strings R, K and P, only <Wimp_ReadSysInfo> 0 supported, sprites in icons do not use colour translations, messages may not be 'filtered' with <Wimp_AddMessages>, etc
300	RISC OS 3.00 WindowManager
	Message 'filtering' is broken, <Wimp_ReadSysInfo> 1 to 7 supported
310	RISC OS 3.10 WindowManager
	Message 'filtering' fixed. No use of <Wimp_TextOp>, <Wimp_SetWatchdogState>, <Wimp_ResizeIcon>.
350	RISC OS 3.5-7 WindowManager
	<Wimp_ReadSysInfo> 8 to 10 supported, <Wimp_ReportError> may have extra buttons
	*nb*: not recognised as an official version
380	Softloadable nested WindowManager
	Nestable windows added, <validation string C=>Wimp_validationstring.C> added, h option in <validation string L=>Wimp_validationstring.L> implemented, 'partial' full size windows implemented, windows may now be opened or forceably redrawn by other tasks

Within this list it is assumed that the features not present in higher versions of the WindowManager are also not present in lower versions.

In the event of the version given being later than the version of the Wimp available, then an error will be generated.

Wimp_Initialise R3 (RISC OS 3.00)
In RISC OS 3.00, but not later versions, R3 on entry to <Wimp_Initialise> should contain a list of acceptable <user messages=>Msg_>, terminated by a 0 word.

If R3 = 0 then all messages are classified as important.

In R3 contains a pointer to a list containing merely the 0 word then *no* messages are important.

{/}[most of this is speculation. anyone care to fill in the details?]{/}

Wimp_Initialise R3 (RISC OS 3.10+)
In RISC OS 3.10 or later, R3 on entry to <Wimp_Initialise> should contain a list of acceptable <user messages=>Msg_>, terminated by a 0 word.

In R3 = 0 then no messages are classified as important except for the 'Quit' message.

In R3 contains a pointer to a list containing merely the 0 word then *all* messages are classified as important.
