#Parent Wimp_

	R2 =	pointer to start address, or 0 if not enough

This call is analogous to <OS_ClaimScreenMemory=>OS:OS_ClaimScreenMemory>. It claims all the memory in the free pool. The memory must be accessed in SVC mode, and <Wimp_Poll> should not be called while memory is reserved.

This call is deprecated.
