Icon relative positions
The position of an indirected text plus sprite icon is determined by the Horizontal, Vertical and Right justified bits (3,4 and 9):

HVR	Horizontal adjust		Vertical adjust
#Line
000	Text & sprite left justified	Text at bottom, sprite at top
001	Text & sprite right justified	Text at bottom
010	Sprite at left, text > +6 units	Text & sprite centered
011	Text at left, sprite at right	Text & sprite centered
100	Text & sprite centered		Text at bottom, sprite at top
101	Text & sprite centered		Text at top, sprite at bottom
110	Text & sprite centered		Text & sprite centered
111	Text at right, sprite at left	Text & sprite centered

Note: If text and sprite overlaps, text will be on top.
