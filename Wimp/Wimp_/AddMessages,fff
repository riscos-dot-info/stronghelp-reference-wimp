=>	R0 =	Pointer to array of <message codes=>Msg_> (terminated with 0 word)

Extends the set of user messages that the task gets. The initial set is given by R3 in <Wimp_Initialise>. 

Note that prior to RISC OS 4, calling this for a task which was receiving all messages would cause it to receive /only/ the messages added.
