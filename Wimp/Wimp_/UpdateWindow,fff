This SWI is similar to <Wimp_RedrawWindow>.
Differences :
  è	Not all of the window has to be updated.
  è	Rectangles are not cleared by Wimp.
  è	Can be called at any time, not just in response to RedrawWindow message.

Note: This SWI does not remove rectangles from Wimp_RedrawWindows list of invalid rectangles. If the area is already invalid, then Wimp will send you redraw messages, even if you have updated the area.
