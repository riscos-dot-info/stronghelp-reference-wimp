Window Flags - bit 22 - Toggle method
This bit is overwritten by the Wimp and may be read using <Wimp_GetWindowState>. If set, it indicates that the window is, or /will be/, toggled to full size without covering the icon bar. Note that this behaviour is different to bit 18, which is set if the window is, or /has been/, toggled to full size including the icon bar.

Toggling behaviour can only be properly resolved after <Wimp_Poll> returns an <Open_Window_Request=>Wimp_Poll2> reason code and before the subsequent call to <Wimp_OpenWindow>. Flags bit 19 is set, by definition; applications may distinguish between different types of toggle-size clicks using the following truth table:

#indent 4
Operation	Bit 22	Bit 21	Bit 18
#line
To full size		0	1	0
From full size		0	0	1
To semi-full size	1	1	0
From semi-full size	0	0	0
#indent

These are the only values that can be returned in combination with bit 19 being set.
