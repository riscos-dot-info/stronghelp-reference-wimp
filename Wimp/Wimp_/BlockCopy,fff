Wimp_BlockCopy  (&400EB)
#Parent Wimp_
=>	R0 =	window handle
	R1 =	source		minx (incl)
	R2 =	 		miny (incl)
	R3 =	 		maxx (excl)
	R4 =	 		maxy (excl)

This SWI copies as much as possible of source-rectangle, to given dest. The rest is invalidated. This call cannot be made from inside a <redraw=>Wimp_RedrawWindow> / <update=>Wimp_UpdateWindow> loop.

All coordinates are relative to the window's work area.

Note that ECF fills and tiling patterns can get out of step with this call (for an example watch the taskmanager in a 2 colour mode).
# N> It screws up with the tiling sprite in 256 colour modes. But I guess not
#    on an A5000
# Gerph> Well, I don't tend to use 256 colours much. If I did I might have
#        noticed. My RPC is a bit nicer though.
