Wimp_BlockCopy  (&400EB)
#Parent Wimp_
=>	R0 =	window handle
	R1 =	source		minx (incl)
	R2 =	 		miny (incl)

This SWI copies as much as possible of source-rectangle, to given dest. The rest is invalidated. This call cannot be made from inside a <redraw=>Wimp_RedrawWindow>/<update=>Wimp_UpdateWindow> loop.

Note that ECF fills and tiling patterns can get out of step with this call (for an example watch the taskmanager in a 2 colour mode).
# N> It screws up with the tiling sprite in 256 colour modes. But I guess not
#    on an A5000
# Gerph> Well, I don't tend to use 256 colours much. If I did I might have
#        noticed. My RPC is a bit nicer though.
