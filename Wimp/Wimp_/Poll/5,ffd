Pointer Entering Window (5)
Returned block contains :
  0 Window handle

This message is returned when the pointer, for some reason, suddenly finds itself over this window. This can be because you moved it there, but also because a menu is closed, a window deleted, or something similar.

Note: If your pointer is over a window, and you delete this and create a new window, all in one go, you will:
 1.	Not get a Pointer_Leaving_Window for the old window.
 2.	Not get a Pointer_Entering_Window for the new one. (Probably because they will have the same handle...)
