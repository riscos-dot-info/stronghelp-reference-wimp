#Parent Wimp_
=>	R1 =	pointer to userbuffer for template, or 0 to find required buffersize
	R2 =	pointer to workspace for indirected data.
	R3 =	pointer to end of workspace (+1?)
	R4 =	pointer to 256-byte array for font ref, or -1 for no fonts
	R5 =	pointer to (wildcarded) name to match (3 aligned words)
	R6 =	position to search from, or 0 for the first call

<=	R0 corrupt
	R2 =	pointer to remaining workspace
	R5	is overwritten with actual name
	R6 =	pos of next entry, or 0 if template not found

if R1 was 0, then :
	R1 =	required size for window and icons
	R2 =	required size for indirected data

Note that R5 *must* point to a word aligned 12 byte buffer, which is used as workspace by the call. BASIC programmers converting to C or Assembler should be careful to set R6.

Errors will not be returned if the template is not found. Instead R6 is set to 0.
