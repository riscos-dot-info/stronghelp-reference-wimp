Wimp_BaseOfSprites  (&400EA)
#Parent Wimp_
<=	R0 =	pointer to ROM sprites area
	R1 =	pointer to RMA sprites area

This SWI gives you the two areas that make up the Wimp sprite pool. Note that the RMA area may move around (when sprites are added) and that Window Managers >= 3.5 actually use a dynamic area instead of the RMA.

You can use these addresses with <OS_SpriteOp=>OS:OS_SpriteOp>, but you should always use <Wimp_SpriteOp>.

The only real use for this SWI is for saving the ROM sprites to a file:

#Wrap off; fCode
  SYS "Wimp_BaseOfSprites" TO ROMBase%,RMABase%
  SYS "OS_SpriteOp",12,ROMBase%,"filename"
#f; wrap
#Line
See <PRM 3, page 203=>PRM-3:203>.
