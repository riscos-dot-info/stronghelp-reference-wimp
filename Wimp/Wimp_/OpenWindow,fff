This call updates the list of active windows. It is used
  1)	When you open a window for the first time, and
  2)	When the window moves, scrolls or resizes.

The Wimp will issue redraw messages to you, if necessary. Under the nested Wimp, its use is slightly <different=>.nested>.

#tab
Note:	Prior to the nested Wimp you could not open windows belonging to other tasks. You were (and still are) able to send other tasks <open window requests=>Wimp_Poll2>.
