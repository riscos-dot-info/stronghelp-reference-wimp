Wimp_DragBox (&400D0)
#Parent Wimp_
=>	R1 =	pointer to <block=>.block>, or -1 to cancel drag
	R2 =	"TASK", invokes R3 as flags word (Wimp 3.80 or later)
	R3 =	<flags=>.ursulaflags>
<=	R0 corrupt
	If R2 was "TASK" on entry, it is cleared
	All other registers preserved.

#tab
This SWI initiates a drag. A drag can span several calls to <Wimp_Poll>, so the task must remember what is being dragged and why. The termination of a drag is reported by <Wimp message 7=>Wimp_Poll7>.
#Line
See <PRM 3, page 145=>PRM-3:145>.
