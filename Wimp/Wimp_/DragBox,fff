This SWI initiates a drag. A drag can span several calls to <Wimp_Poll>, so the task must remember what is being dragged and why.
The termination of a drag is reported by <Wimp message 7=>Wimp_Poll7>.
#Line
See <PRM 3, page 145=>PRM-3:145>, <DragASprite_Start>, and <DragAnObject_Start=>MiscSWIs:DragAnObject_Start>.
