<=	R0 corrupt

This must be called immediately before the task terminates by calling <OS_Exit=>OS:OS_Exit>. If it is not, then the task has a last chance to trap its shutdown by means of the <WimpCloseDown service=>OS:service_53> (which will also be called if the task exits normally).

Task handle and magic word are only required if closing a task which is not presently paged in (eg a module).
