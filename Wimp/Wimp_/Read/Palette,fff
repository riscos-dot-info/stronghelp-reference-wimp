Wimp_ReadPalette  (&400E5)
#Parent Wimp_
=>	R1 =	pointer to 20-word <palette block=>Wimp_paletteblock>
	R2 =	"TRUE" (&45555254) to return true colour
<=	R0 corrupt
	block contains palette definitions

This SWI returns the current Wimp palette settings, in the form &B0G0R0LL, where L is the logical colour number used for the Wimp colour 0 to 15 (or %TTGGGGGG in 256 colour modes). Note that even when the values are masked to give &B0G0R000 this is not correct for passing to ColourTrans.

If 'TRUE' is used, then the true colour values are returned.
