This SWI can be used to plot a 'virtual' icon during a window redraw/update loop. RISC OS 3 allows its use outside a window redraw/update loop with absolute screen coordinates.

Note: If used outside the redraw/update loop, the graphic area will be reset to the current screen mode. This is not good if outputing to a sprite.
