Acknowledge
This prevents a broadcast message from being passed on, and a UserMessage_Recorded from being returned to the sender.

call <Wimp_SendMessage> with :
{f25}Þ{f}	your_ref	=	0 (iff finding task handle of a window/icon)
 	 		 	else it should be from the my_ref field
 	R2		=	task/window handle
 	R3		=	icon handle if R2 = -2
{f25}Ü{f}	R2	=	task handle.

You can also use this if you only want to find out who owns a window or an icon on the iconbar.
