Acknowledge
This prevents a broadcast message from being passed on, and a UserMessage_Recorded from being returned to the sender.

call <Wimp_SendMessage> with :
=>	your_ref	=	0 if finding task handle of a window/icon
 	 		 	otherwise it should be copied from the my_ref field
 	R0		=	19 (poll code)
 	R2		=	task/window handle
 	R3		=	icon handle if R2 = -2
<=	R2	=	task handle.

You can also use this if you only want to find out who owns a window or an icon on the iconbar.
