Receiving UserMessages (17,18,19)
17	UserMessage			Doesn't expect a reply
18	UserMessage_Recorded		If no one answers, it returns.
19	<UserMessage_Acknowledge=>Wimp_SendMessage3>  	Confirmation that UM_Recorded was received.

Format of block :
 0	length of block
 4	Handle of sender
 8	my ref
 12	your ref
 16	<message code=>Msg_>
 20	..data..

To acknowledge message, first set your_ref = my_ref, and then either just call Wimp_SendMessage,19 which stops the message from returning, or send any UserMessage back to the sender.
