Most often, this SWI is used to send <user messages=>wimp_sendmessage1>. Sending an Acknowledge (R0 = 19) to a window allows its parent's task handle to be found.

{*}Note:{*}	In versions of the Window Manager prior to 4.00, message blocks in dynamic areas will not have their sender and my_ref fields filled.
