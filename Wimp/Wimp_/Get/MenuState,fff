=>	R0 =	0	to return the current menu tree state
	 	1	report tree leading up to, but not including, a window/icon pair
	R1 =	buffer for result.
	R2 =	window handle of menu, if R0 = 1
	R3 =	icon handle of entry in menu, if R0 = 1

	R1 =	filled buffer
#Wrap

If there are no errors the buffer is filled with a list of numbers in, same as the one you get after a <menu selection=>wimp_poll9>.

This list returned will be null, ie. buffer+0 = -1, if;

 if R0 = 1 and the Window/icon in R2/R3 is not in the tree, or
 if R0 = 0 and the menu is owned by a different application, or has been closed
