Wimp_GetPointerInfo  (&400CF)
#Parent Wimp_
=>	R1 =	pointer to block
<=	R0 corrupted
	Block contains :
	  0	Mouse x
	  4	Mouse y
	  8	<Button state=>wimp_getpointerinfo0>
	  12	Window handle (-1 for backgr, -2 for iconbar)
	  16	<Icon handle=>wimp_getpointerinfo1>
	  
This would appear to return not the current mouse state but its state when the last <Wimp_Poll> was executed. This means that it is perfectly safe to use it after a long menu click delay to recreate the menu or as a means of dragging boxes.
