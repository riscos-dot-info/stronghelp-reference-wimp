Wimp manual
#Parent !Root
The StrongHelp Wimp manual is a companion of the <OS=>OS:!Root> manual. Together, they document almost all SWI calls available in RISC OS 2 through to RISC OS 5. The Wimp manual deals primarily with the operation of parts of the OS directly related to the desktop. It can be obtained from the usual place (<http://sudden.recoil.org/stronghelp/=>#url>).
