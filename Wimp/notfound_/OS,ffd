OS manual
#Parent !Root
The StrongHelp OS manual is a companion of the <Wimp=>Wimp:!Root> manual. Together, they document almost all SWI calls available in RISC OS 2 through to RISC OS 5. The OS manual deals primarily with the lower level operation of the OS. It can be obtained from the usual place (<http://sudden.recoil.org/stronghelp/=>#url>)
