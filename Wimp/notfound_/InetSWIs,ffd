InetSWIs manual
#Parent !Root
The StrongHelp InetSWIs manual details SWI calls which support internet applications. Together with the <InetSocket=>InetSocket:!Root> manual (which details the support calls that other modules provide) it should detail almost all of the internet stack. It can be obtained from the usual place (<http://sudden.recoil.org/stronghelp/=>#url>).
