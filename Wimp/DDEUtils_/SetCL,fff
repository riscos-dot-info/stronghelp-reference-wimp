DDEUtils_SetCL  (&42582)
#Parent DDEUtils_
=>	R0 =	pointer to zero terminated command line
<=	R0 preserved

This SWI is used to set the command line of the length specified in <DDEUtils_SetCLSize>.

Note:	The command line is actually terminated at the first *control* character. This is very annoying.
