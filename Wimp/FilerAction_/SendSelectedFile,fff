FilerAction_SendSelectedFile  (&40F81)
#Parent FilerAction_
=>	R0 =	handle of the task Filer_Action just started.
	R1 =	pointer to leafnames of files to be acted upon.

Each filename has to be separated by a single space - {/}e.g.{/} '{fCode}File1 File2 File3{f}'.

This SWI buffers filenames until it fills a message block, at which point it sends them to the Filer_Action task using <Message_FilerAddSelection=>MSG_404>.

To start the operation see <FilerAction_SendStartOperation> (which will first send any remaining buffered names to the task).
