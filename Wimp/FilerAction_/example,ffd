Example of using Filer_Action
#Parent FilerAction_
Here is a BASIC example of how to use the Filer_Action module to Copy files with Verbose on via the multitasking Filer Action Window.

{fcode}SYS "<Wimp_StartTask>","Filer_Action" TO taskhandle%
SYS "<FilerAction_SendSelectedDirectory>",taskhandle%,sourcedirectorypathname$
SYS "<FilerAction_SendSelectedFile>",taskhandle%,sourcefilesleafnames$
SYS†"<FilerAction_SendStartOperation>",taskhandle%,0,1,targetdirectorypathname$+CHR$0,LEN(targetdirectorypathname$)+1
{f}

Note:
The exact pathname of 'source/targetdirectorypathname$' will appear in the Filer Action window, so if you use a system variable in this then it looks untidy and the user will not be shown the true path being used.

è	Remember that this is RISC OS 3 or above only.
