Bits	Meaning
#Line
0-1	Horizontal location of sprite in box:
	 00	Left
	 01	Centre
	 10	Right
	 11	undefined
2-3	Vertical location of sprite in box:
	 00	Bottom
	 01	Centre
	 10	Top
	 11	undefined
4-5	Drag bounding box is:
	 00	Whole screen
	 01	Display area of window that the pointer is over
	 10	User specified
	 11	undefined
6	Bounding box applies to:
	 0	The box
	 1	The pointer
7	Use drop shadow
8	Don't dither sprite (RISC OS 3.50)
9	Centre sprite around pointer (RISC OS 4.00)
10-15	Reserved for future use, should be set to 0.
16	Rendering is done by:
	 0	a <SWI=>DragAnObject_withSWI>
	 1	a <C/assembler function=>DragAnObject_withFN>
17	If the renderer is a function, it is called in:
	 0	<User mode=>.note>
	 1	SVC mode
18	Actually use <user mode=>.note>
18-31	Reserved for future use, should be set to 0.
#subpage note
Note about DragAnObject User mode
#wrap on
Prior to version 0.09 (Castle), DragAnObject would call client functions in
SVC mode even when asked to call them in user mode. On 32 bit systems, this
leads to an incorrect stack limit which leads to aborts.

Rather than fix the module, which may cause further faults in existing
clients, a new bit (b18) indicates that the function should actually be
called in user mode. If bit 18 is set, bit 17 should be clear.

The calling environment should be set up sufficiently to allow access to user
and C library statics, provided that DragAnObject_Start was called via a
veneer that preserves R10 and R11 (sl and fp). OSLib and _kernel_swi veneers
are fine, and _swi is fine except on an unpatched RISC OS 3.70/3.71.
