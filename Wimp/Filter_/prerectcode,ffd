Rect filter code
#Parent Filter_RegisterRectFilter
=>	R0 =	0 if no more to redraw
	R2 =	task handle
	R6 =	minimum x
	R7 =	minimum y
	R8 =	maximum x
	R9 =	maximum y
	R12 =	value of R2 when filter registered
<=	all registers preserved

This is called before the redraw of a rectangle begins, before the background has been filled, and before the VDU graphics window has been set up.

You should not fiddle with these things, I would have thought.
