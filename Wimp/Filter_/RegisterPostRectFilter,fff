Filter_RegisterPostRectFilter
#Parent Filter_
=>	R0 =	pointer to zero terminated filter name
	R1 =	address of <filter code=>Filter_rectcode>
	R2 =	value to be passed in R12
	R3 =	task handle of task to which filter is applied or 0 for all tasks

<=	all registers preserved

Adds a new <Wimp_GetRectangle> post-filter to the list of post-filters.

The address pointed to by R1 will be called whenever the task who's handle is passed in R3 calls <Wimp_GetRectangle> with R12 equal to the value of R2 when this SWI is called.
