Filter_RegisterPostFilter  (&42641)
#Parent Filter_
=>	R0 =	Pointer to zero terminated filter name
	R1 =	Addresss of <filter code=>Filter_postcode>
	R2 =	Value to be passed in R12
	R3 =	Task handle of task to which filter is applied, or 0 for all tasks
	R4 =	Event <mask=>Wimp_pollmask> (1 bit masks the event out as for <Wimp_Poll>)

<=	all registers preserved

This SWI adds a new post filter to the list of post filters. Whenever the Wimp is about to return from <Wimp_Poll> to the task with handle specified by R3, the address pointed to by R1 will be called, with R12 set to the value given in R2 when the filter was registered.
