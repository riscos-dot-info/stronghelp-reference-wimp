Filter_DeRegisterPostRectFilter  (&42649)  (0.18)
#Parent Filter_
=>	R0 =	pointer to zero terminated filter name
	R1 =	addresss of <filter code=>Filter_postrectcode>
	R2 =	value to be passed in R12
	R3 =	task handle of task to which filter was applied
	
<=	all registers preserved

This SWI removes a <Wimp_GetRectangle> post-filter from the list.

Note: All registers must be the same as those passed to <Filter_RegisterPostRectFilter>.

*Note:* This is still only a 'guess' at the way it works.
