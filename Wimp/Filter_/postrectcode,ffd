Post rect filter code
#Parent Filter_RegisterPostRectFilter
=>	R0 =	0 if no more to redraw
	R2 =	task handle
	R6 =	minimum x
	R7 =	minimum y
	R8 =	maximum x
	R9 =	maximum y
	R10 =	window handle - 1
	R12 =	value of R2 when filter registered
<=	all registers preserved

This is called after the window background is filled, before <Wimp_GetRectange> returns, unless the call is returning with 'no more to do' status. This is not called due to <Wimp_UpdateWindow> since it does not fill the background, but is is called after a transparent window would have been filled.

You can probably modify the updated block, but R0 and R1 should probably remain as passed.
