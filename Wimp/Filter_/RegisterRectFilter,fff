Filter_RegisterRectFilter  (&42644)  (0.18)
#Parent Filter_
=>	R0 =	pointer to zero terminated filter name
	R1 =	address of <filter code=>Filter_prerectcode>
	R2 =	value to be passed in R12
	R3 =	task handle of task to which filter is applied or 0 for all tasks

<=	all registers preserved

Adds a new <Wimp_GetRectangle> pre-filter to the list of pre-filters.

The address pointed to by R1 will be called whenever the task who's handle is passed in R3 calls <Wimp_GetRectangle> with R12 equal to the value of R2 when this SWI is called.

Note: This is still only a 'guess' at the way it works.
