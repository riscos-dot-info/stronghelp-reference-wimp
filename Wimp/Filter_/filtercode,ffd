=>	R0 =	Event mask as passed to <Wimp_Poll> for Pre filters
	 	Event reason code being returned for Post filters
	R1 =	User's event buffer
	R2 =	Task handle of task that called Wimp_Poll

#Wrap

<=	Pre:	It may clear bits in R0 to provide a new event mask
	 	It must preserve all other registers

	Post:	The routine may modify the reason code in R0 and the contents of the buffer pointed to by R1 to provide a new event
	 	R0 = -1 to prevent event being passed to task
	 	It must preserve R1 and R2.
