Filter Wimp_GetRectangle icon plotting code
#Parent Filter_RegisterPostIconFilter
=>	R0 =	window handle
	R2 =	task handle
	R6 =	minimum x
	R7 =	minimum y
	R8 =	maximum x
	R9 =	maximum y
	R10 =	window handle - 1
	R12 =	value of R2 when filter registered
<=	all registers preserved

This is called after the Wimp has redraw the icons in a window, before moving onto the next rectangle. This allows applications to plot over their window's icons.

You can probably modify the updated block, but R0 and R1 should probably remain as passed.
